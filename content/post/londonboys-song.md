最近有時會在Youtube上聽一些7、80年代的歐陸迪斯可舞曲，右邊的相關影片都會出現London Boys的歌曲，我之前並沒有聽過他們的歌，好奇之下點來聽，發現還不錯，特別適合用來提神醒腦。London Boys是來自英國倫敦的Edem Ephraim（主唱）和來自牙買加的Dennis Fuller（合音、編舞）組成的男子二人組，1986年在德國漢堡市出道，往後數年間推出多首經典的舞曲，大多是由唱片製作人Ralf René Maué所創作。除了歌曲本身引人注意外，兩人的身手也相當矯健，登台表演時搭配的舞蹈動作讓觀眾目不轉睛，間奏時來個空翻更是令人驚呼連連，這篇就來寫寫他們的歌曲當中我最喜歡的三首，也是他們在80年代時的代表作。

### 1. I'm Gonna Give My Heart（1986）
{{< youtube UcJC40m1zpE >}}
<br/>
I'm gonna give my heart  
I'm gonna give my heart  
I'm gonna give it, never leave a teardrop in the dark  
I'm gonna take my pride  
The trouble and the strife  
This time you'll find me standin' up and quiet prepared to fight  

I'm gonna take you up  
I'm gonna take you down  
I'm gonna step into your life and turn it  
Round an' round  
I'm gonna kiss your lips  
I'm gonna feel your hips  
I'm gonna let your body melt into my fingertips  

Nothing ever last forever  
Nothing stays the same  
In this world you will discover  
Rainbows follow rain  

I'm gonna give my heart  
Gonna give it from the start  
Give it, right from the start  
Yes I'm gonna give my heart  
Gonna give it all I got and heaven knows I got a lot  

Gonna give my heart  
Gonna give my heart  
I'm gonna give you all my love  
Gonna give my heart  
Gonna give my heart  
I wanna give you all my love  

I'm gonna saddle up  
Don't wanna settle down  
I'm gonna saddle up tonight we're gonna paint the town  
No matter what you say  
No matter how you pray  
I'm sick and tired of waitin' for you walking in the rain  

Nothing ever last forever  
Nothing stays the same  
In this world you will discover  
Rainbows follow rain  

I'm gonna give my heart  
Gonna give it from the start  
Give it, right from the start  
Yes I'm gonna give my heart  
Gonna give it all I got and heaven knows I got a lot  

I'm gonna give my heart  
Gonna give it from the start  
Give it, right from the start  
Yes I'm gonna give my heart  
Gonna give it all I got and heaven knows I got a lot  

Gonna give my heart  
Gonna give my heart  
I'm gonna give you all my love  
Gonna give my heart  
Gonna give my heart  
I wanna give you all my love

Give a little love - and love last forever  
Give a little love - and don't make me cry  
Give a little love - if you lose the motion  
Give a little love - with you it's goodbye  
Give a little love - the plane that is leaving  
Give a little love - our hearts on the ground  
Give a little love - where music is leading  
Give a little love - the lost and the found  

We let live and let love live beside us  
We're like averybody else who live to guide us  
If there's hope and love across the nation  
Everybody find a recreation  

London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you  
London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you  
London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you wild  
When the party's out and the fever drives you  
I wanna get up tonight  
I wanna keep on loving you  
I got a feeling that's right  
I wanna give you all my love for you  

Give a little love - I walk through the city  
Give a little love - there's food in the air  
Give a little love - hello Piccadilly  
Give a little love - the wind in my hair  
Give a little love - the beat of tomorrow  
Give a little love - from Rome to L.A  
Give a little love - just move a bit closer  
Give a little love - d'you hear what I say?  

We let live and let love live beside us  
We're like averybody else who live to guide us  
If there's hope and love across the nation  
Everybody find a recreation  

London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you  
London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you  
London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you wild  
When the party's out and the fever drives you  
I wanna get up tonight  
I wanna keep on loving you  
I got a feeling that's right  
I wanna give you all my love for you  

If there's hope and love across the nation  
Everybody find a recreatio  
London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you  
London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you  
London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you wild  
When the party's out and the fever drives you  
I wanna get up tonight  
I wanna keep on loving you  
I got a feeling that's right  
I wanna give you all my love for you  

London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you  
London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you  
London nights - when the party's out and the fever drives you wild  
when the party's out and the fever drives you wild...
